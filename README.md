# rsMud - A mud client for the terminal

rsMud has been a passion project of mine for some time. A big user of the old but great tinyfugue I always wanted to create my own similar mud client. Even though I don't play much muds these days.

### Goal
- Completely terminal based
- Powerful but not custom scripting language (eg. lua, js or python)
- Low resource and fast
