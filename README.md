# Blightmud  : A mud client for the terminal

Blightmud has been a passion project of mine for some time. A big user of the old
but great tinyfugue I always wanted to create my own similar mud client. Even
though I don't play much muds these days.

## The name?
The client is written in rust. Some navigating throught the thesaurus brought me to the word 'blight' and here we are.

## Goals
- [x] Completely terminal based
- [x] Lua scripting
    - [x] Output and sending
    - [x] Aliases
    - [x] Triggers
    - [x] Prompt triggers
    - [x] Gagging triggers
    - [ ] GMCP hooks and sending
- [x] Low resource and fast
- [ ] In client help and manuals

## Compiling
- Install rust
- Run 'cargo build'

## Contributing
- Yes please!
